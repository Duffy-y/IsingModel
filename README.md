<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As part of the C Programming teaching unit taught in the third year of a bachelor's degree in the Magister of Fundamental Physics at Paris-Saclay's University, we had to develop and implement a physical system in C as our final project. I chose to take advantage of the speed of C/C++ to study a quite simple system, altough requiring a large number of iterations to reach equilibrium (assuming existence ...). Thus, here is my current project on the 2D Ising model, which could be easily generalized to an n-dimensional Ising model since I've took care of making Wolff Algorithm and Metropolis Algorithm as much agnostic as possible about the dimension of the lattice.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To run locally the project, we've included a basic Makefile to shorten the compilation process. 

### Prerequisites
- Python C-API
  
1. Change Python C-API include directory in Makefile
   ```
   PYTHON := -I/path -lpython3.12
   ```
   Change `python3.12` to your corresponding python's version.

### Installation

1. Clone directory and cd into it
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Duffy-y/IsingModel. && cd ./IsingModel
   ```

2. Run included Makefile
   ```sh
   make
   ```
